To run this app, follow the below steps:

1. Open this backend folder in your code editor (liken VS Code)
2. Open the terminal and run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies required to run this app.
3. After the installation is finished, go the terminal and write the command `npm start` to run the server.
4. Now the server will start and you are good to use that in Postman or your frontend.

Thanks.
